differentiation's between Vector and ArrayList.

Vector is synchronized by default, and ArrayList is not. Note : you can make ArrayList also 
synchronized by passing arraylist object to Collections.synchronizedList() method. 
Synchronized means : it can be used with multiple threads with out any side effect.

ArrayLists grow by 50% of the previous size when space is not sufficient for new element, 
where as Vector will grow by 100% of the previous size when there is no space for new incoming 
element.


->LinkedList is faster in add and remove, but slower in get
